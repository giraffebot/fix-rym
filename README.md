custom javascript/css to re-render rateyourmusic so it doesn't look like trash

things that need to be fixed that i cannot
- non-square album covers render improperly
- window resizing needs to be dealt with better i don't know how to do that help
- clicking out of search bar to select a searchtype clears text. i predicted this behavior but i don't know of any alternatives
